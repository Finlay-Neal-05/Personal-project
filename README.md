# Finlay Neal 05 Dev Academy personal project. 

## SETUP

#### **From the command line**

During my time at dev academy I was tasked with coming up with, and pitching a personal project. At the time I came up with this idea. It is a take on the popular to-do app, except instead of tracking tasks I decided to track time slots, to make the program a little more complex and to include some algorithms for me to practice with. 

simply add a task and choose a weekly time commitment, then use the pause play funcitonality to track your tasks!

### tech used so far:

* react.js
* express
* knex / sqlite
* superagent

clone this repo and then...
```
cd Personal-Project
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can find the server running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the client running on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
